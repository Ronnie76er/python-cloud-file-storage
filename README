Beginnings of a common python API for cloud file storage solutions.

Got a very simple dropbox plugin setup using the official python API from Dropbox.

Suggested Planned support for:
Dropbox
Ubuntu One
SpiderOak
This was written before WWDC, but maybe iCloud or whatever?
S3 (possibly using boto)
SugarSync

Let me know of others that you think would be a good fit.
